/* 
TypeError: Cannot read property 'forEach' of undefined
Arrow functions are not effective as object methods because of the way 
they use lexical scoping for this..

Since the object does not create a lexical scope, the arrow function method 
looks for this in the outer scopeâ€“Window in this example. Since the numbers 
property does not exist on the Window object, it throws an error. As a general 
rule, it is safer to use traditional functions as object methods by default.
