/* 
The objects key1 and key2 are converted to strings because object properties 
must be strings.Because "[object Object]" is the default string representation 
for objects,both key1 and key2 are converted to that string.
 
This can cause errors that may not be obvious because itâ€™s logical to assume 
that different object keys would, in fact, be different.The conversion to the
default string representation makes it difficult to use objects as keys.
