/* 
Iterators are an important part of ECMAScript 6, and as such, you don’t
need to create your own iterators for many built-in types: the language
includes them by default. You only need to create iterators when the builtin
iterators don’t serve your purpose, which will most frequently be when
defining your own objects or classes. Otherwise, you can rely on built-in
iterators to do your work. Perhaps the most common iterators you’ll use
are those that work on collections.
*/



/* 
ECMAScript 6 has three types of collection objects: arrays, maps, and sets.
All three have the following built-in iterators to help you navigate their
content:

entries() Returns an iterator whose values are key-value pairs

values() Returns an iterator whose values are the values of the
collection

keys() Returns an iterator whose values are the keys contained in the
collection

You can retrieve an iterator for a collection by calling one of these
methods.


Remember only reason for of loop is able to iterate over arrays,maps
or set coz they provide there iterator for iterating..
