let colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue'];

for (let i = 0; i < colors.length; i++) {
  console.log(colors[i])
}

/* 
This standard for loop tracks the index into the colors array using the
i variable. The value of i increments each time the loop executes if i isnâ€™t
larger than the length of the array (stored in len).
Although this loop is fairly straightforward, loops grow in complexity
when you nest them and need to keep track of multiple variables.
Additional complexity can lead to errors..
