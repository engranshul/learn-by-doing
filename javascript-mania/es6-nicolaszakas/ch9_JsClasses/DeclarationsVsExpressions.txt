Classes and functions are similar in that they have two forms: declarations
and expressions. 

Function and class declarations begin with an appropriate
keyword (function or class, respectively) followed by an identifier. Functions
have an expression form that doesn’t require an identifier after function;
similarly, classes have an expression form that doesn’t require an identifier
after class. These class expressions are designed to be used in variable 
declarations or passed into functions as arguments.
